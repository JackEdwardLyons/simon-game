# simon-game
A Simon Game as part of the Free Code Camp Front End Development Certificate.

This game was built using Vanilla JS, but uses jQuery for the Material Design library. Material Design is cool, and this was my first time using the library.

## How to play

1. Begin the game -- the computer will light up a square and make a sound.
2. It's your turn to follow. Every correct tile click brings you to a new level.
3. Each level builds upon the previous sequence, then adds one more...
4. Try the game in Strict Mode for an extra challenge - If you make a mistake you go back all the way to the start.

Enjoy.
